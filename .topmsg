Subject: [PATCH] tcp: L4S ECT(1) identifier for CC modules

When ECN is successfully negociated for a TCP flow, it defaults to
always use ECT(0) in the IP header. L4S service, however, needs to
use ECT(1).

This patch enables congestion control algorithms to control whether
ECT(0) or ECT(1) should be used on a per-segment basis. A new
CA module flag (TCP_CONG_WANTS_ECT_1) defines the behavior
expected by the CA when not-yet initialized for the connection.
As such, it implicitely assumes that the CA also has the
TCP_CONG_NEEDS_ECN set.
