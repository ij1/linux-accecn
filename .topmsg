Subject: [PATCH] dctcp: increase alpha precision

The alpha decay precision is lower bounded by shifting right
by dctcp_shift_g (4 by default). That is, if alpha is less than
2^dctcp_shift_g, alpha is set to zero by this:
  alpha -= min_not_zero(alpha, alpha >> dctcp_shift_g);
This creates quite high low-cut off threshold (0.0156) which
causes non-continuous response affecting convergence when
the DCTCP flow oscillates between low alpha and zero alpha.

Changing DCTCP_ALPHA_SHIFT requires expanding some of the
temporal variables to u64 to avoid overflows during computation.
