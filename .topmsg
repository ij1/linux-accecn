Subject: [PATCH] net: return low-level tstamps to sender

Reuse existing timestamping infrastructure but set the timestamp
to the original (sent) skb instead or in addition to the
new/cloned skb that is put the err queue.

The internal timestamp is placed into shinfo to the same location
as hwtstamps to allow hw filling them.

Interestingly, prior to 49ca0d8bfaf3b (net-timestamp: no-payload
option), the orig_skb hwtstamps were set before a clone was made
so the timestamp was available on the original. The change
description does not go into details whether the change was
intentional or not.
