Subject: [PATCH] tcp: Add ECT(1) for CC modules

When ECN is successfully negociated for a TCP flow, it defaults to
always use ECT(0) in the IP header.

This patch enables congestion control algorithms to control whether
ECT(0) or ECT(1) should be used on a per-segment basis. A new
CA module flag (TCP_CONG_WANTS_ECT_1) defines the behavior
expected by the CA when not-yet initialized for the connection.
As such, it implicitely assumes that the CA also has the
TCP_CONG_NEEDS_ECN set.
