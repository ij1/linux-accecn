Subject: [PATCH] tcp: Add the TCP Prague congestion control module

TCP Prague is a variant of DCTCP aimed to be used over the public
Internet. As such, it implements a couple of safety requirements and
uses the ECT(1) ECN codepoint, as defined in the L4S experiment.

This base version enhances DCTCP by:
- Requesting the use of ECT(1) for all packets.
- Supporting various RTT independence modes
- Updating the EWMA to support low marking probabilities
- Improved the accuracy of the cwnd manipulations, notably preserving
  remainders
- Switching to unsaturated marking during additive increase
- Controlling pacing/GSO sizing
