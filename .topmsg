Subject: [PATCH] tcp: rework {__,}tcp_ecn_check_ce() -> tcp_data_ecn_check()

Rename tcp_ecn_check_ce to tcp_data_ecn_check as it is
called only for data segments, not for ACKs (with AccECN,
also ACKs may get ECN bits).

The extra "layer" in tcp_ecn_check_ce() function just
checks for ECN being enabled, that can be moved into
tcp_ecn_field_check rather than having the __ variant.

No functional changes.
