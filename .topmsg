Subject: [PATCH] tcp: extend TCP flags to allow AE bit/ACE field

With AccECN, there's one additional TCP flag to be used (AE)
and ACE field that overloads the definition of AE, CWR, and
ECE flags. As tcp_flags was previously only 1 byte, the
byte-order stuff needs to be added to it's handling.

Reorganize the bitfields to not enlarge the structure.
