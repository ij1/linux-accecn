Subject: [PATCH] tcp: AccECN core

This change implements Accurate ECN without negotiation and
AccECN Option (that will be added by later changes). Based on
AccECN specifications:
  https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn-11.txt

Accurate ECN allows feeding back the number of CE (congestion
experienced) marks accurately to the sender in contrast to
RFC3168 ECN that can only signal one marks-seen-yes/no per RTT.
Congestion control algorithms can take advantage of the accurate
ECN information to fine-tune their congestion response to avoid
drastic rate reduction when only mild congestion is encountered.

With Accurate ECN, tp->received_ce (r.cep in AccECN spec) keeps
track of how many segments have arrived with a CE mark. Accurate
ECN uses ACE field (ECE, CWR, AE) to communicate the value back
to the sender which updates tp->delivered_ce (s.cep) based on the
feedback. This signalling channel is lossy when ACE field overflow
occurs. The receiver tried to avoid causing an ACE overflow itself
by limiting the outbound ACE field delta.

Conservative strategy is selected here to deal with the ACE
overflow, however, some strategies using the AccECN option later
in the overall patchset mitigate against false overflows detected.

The ACE field values on the wire are offset by
TCP_ACCECN_CEP_INIT_OFFSET. Delivered_ce/received_ce count the
real CE marks rather than forcing all downstream users to adapt
to the wire offset.
