Subject: [PATCH] tcp: sack option handling improvements

1) Don't early return when sack doesn't fit. AccECN code will be
   placed after this fragment so no early returns please.

2) Make sure opts->num_sack_blocks is not left undefined. E.g.,
   tcp_current_mss() does not memset its opts struct to zero.
   AccECN code checks if SACK option is present and may even
   alter it to make room for AccECN option when many SACK blocks
   are present. Thus, num_sack_blocks needs to be always valid.
