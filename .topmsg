Subject: [PATCH] tcp: allow RFC3168 CWR to be set only for singular skbs

Due to differences in interpreting the CWR bit between RFC3168
and Accurate ECN, it is better to never pass a super skb which
would need to be split into segment that have distinct CWR bits.

This is probably not strictly necessary but allows removing
th->cwr = 0; special case from GSO.
