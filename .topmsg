Subject: [PATCH] tcp: AccECN core

This change implements Accurate ECN without negotiation and
AccECN Option (that will be added by later changes). Based on
AccECN specifications:
  https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn-11.txt

Accurate ECN allows feeding back the number of CE (congestion
experienced) marks accurately to the sender in contrast to
RFC3168 ECN that can only signal marks seen yes/no one per RTT.
Congestion control algorithms can take advantage of the accurate
ECN information to fine-tune their congestion response to avoid
drastic rate reduction when only mild congestion is encountered.
