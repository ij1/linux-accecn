Subject: [PATCH] tcp: AccECN option

The Accurate ECN allows echoing back the sum of bytes for
each IP ECN field value in the received packets using
AccECN option. This change implements AccECN option tx & rx
side processing without option send control related features
that are added by a later change.

Based on specification:
  https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn-14.txt
(Some features of the spec will be added in the later changes
rather than in this one, most importantly, the field order
bit in the highest bit of the first byte counter).

A full-length AccECN option is always attempted but if it does
not fit, the minimum length is selected based on the counters
that have changed since the last update. The AccECN option
(with 24-bit fields) often ends in odd sizes so the option
write code tries to take advantage of some nop used to pad
the other TCP options.

The delivered_ecn_bytes pairs with received_ecn_bytes similar
to how delivered_ce pairs with received_ce. In contrast to
ACE field, however, the option is not always available to update
delivered_ecn_bytes. For ACK w/o AccECN option, the delivered
bytes calculated based on the cumulative ACK+SACK information
are assigned to one of the counters using an estimation
heuristic to select the most likely ECN byte counter. Any
estimation error is corrected when the next AccECN option
arrives. It may occur that the heuristic gets too confused
when there are enough different byte counter deltas between
ACKs with the AccECN option in which case the heuristic just
gives up on updating the counters for a while.

tcp_ecn_option sysctl can be used to select option sending
mode for AccECN.
