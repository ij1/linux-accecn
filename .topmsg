Subject: [PATCH] tcp: try to fit AccECN option with SACK

As SACK blocks tend to eat all option space when there are
many holes, it is useful to compromise on sending many SACK
blocks in every ACK and try to fit AccECN option there
by reduction the number of SACK blocks. But never go below
two SACK blocks because of AccECN option.

As AccECN option is often not put to every ACK, the space
hijack is usually only temporary.
